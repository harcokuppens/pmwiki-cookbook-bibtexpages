text=%0a!! Bibtex sources by Members of our Group\\%0a%0a%0aAdd the bibtex for your publications here. The publications you add here are directly shown on the  [[Publications]] wiki page. %0a%0a!!! Criteria %0a%0aThe next 3 principles make clear what should not be uploaded into year X's bibtex page:%0a%0a# Preprints should not be included%0a# Publications that have not yet been published or only as online first should not be included now, but only when published%0a# Publications that do not mention an affiliation with our organisation for at least one of the authors should not be included%0a%0a!!! How does it work%0a%0aFor each year we have a separate wiki page listed on the left side menu. %0a%0aJust edit the page of the year of the publication.  The source of the page is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX|Bibtex source]] and not pmwiki markup. These%0apages are handled specially within the wiki using a special bibtex to html convertor. This convertor prepends the contents%0aof the [[Bibtex/Definitions]] page to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX|Bibtex source]] so that we can reuse the definitions every year. %0a%0aThe [[Bibtex/Definitions]] page together with all years pages together are used to generate a static html page shown by the [[Publications]] wiki page. This is done automatically when you edit any bibtex page here, causing the publications you add here to be directly shown on the  [[Publications]] wiki page. We generate a static html file so that loading of the [[Publications]] wiki page is fast.
